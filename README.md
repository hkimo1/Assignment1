# Assignment1

**This repository is for assignment 1.**

My name is Hayat Kimo. 
I am a Data Science Graduate Student at Seattle University and 
this my first semester and am learning more about github!

So far,I did the hello-world practice and learned how to create a repository, branch, make, commit change and opening a pull request.I have also learned how to clone a repository into my local computer which was a fun thing to learn. I am a little bit confused on how to write codes on github.

I have downloaded Python 3.13 and Pycharm. I also had Visual studio from my previous classes but I have upgraded that as well. 
I have installed jupyter notebook in my Windows Machine and Gitbash. I used the Command Prompt to install jupyter notebook and it runs in my we browser.

**Iâ€™ve finished the course. Please review.**
